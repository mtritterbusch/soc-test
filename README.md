# SOC Test
## Instructions
1. Fork this repo
2. Write a small app that accepts a csv file as an upload. The csv file is a contact list. The contents of the list need to be inserted into a database. There needs to be a way to view and delete after the upload.
4. Either demonstrate in code or provide an explanation in this README on how you would handle very large files.
5. Either demonstrate in code or provide an explanation in this README on how you would handle different encodings.
6. Submit this as a pull request.
## Complete
1. Repo forked
2. Contact list can be uploaded and previewed and marked for deletion.  Also includes pagination. 
## TODO
1. Save to database
2. Additional mappings can be set up in map_csvfile() for different csv formats.  No handling of Unicode (yet).
3. Very ugly and basic; could use some better css/formatting.
